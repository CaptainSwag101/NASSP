A little word about sources...

Theses source files contains material from SDK, from other Add-On public.

Any part of these source can be reused freely in any orbiter projects. 

This code is made public to let NASSP Add-on live is life while I suffer from lack of time to continue the effort by myself.

So First Good luck, I'm not quite a "clean programmer" and most of the source can be optimized.

Ideally NASSP 4.1 modifications should be submitted to me before public release (Yes, that mean I'm not opposed to the publications of enhancements, that's the goal :)), the code should be included.
Main reason is I'd like to keep the project coherent and I wann be able to oublish my own mods...
