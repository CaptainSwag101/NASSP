  Tracing class. This is defined as a class so that it can be allocated on the
  stack in each function, then the constructor and destructor message will
  always be produced automatically when it's entered and exited. It also makes
  keeping track of the function name easy, so that you don't need to put it
  in every trace message manually.

// those of any other objects you allocate on the stack. Otherwise you may not get
// to see the "Starting" message if one of those constructors crashes.
//
// Unfortunately in certain circumstances the destructor seems to get called when
// an error occurs, so you can't definitely rely on the "Done" message to tell
// you that the function completely successfully... if you're not certain, then
// put in another TRACE message just before it should exit.
